	<h1>At the Window</h1>
	<h2>DH Lawrence</h2>
	<p><i>The pine-trees bend to listen to the autumn wind as it
	mutters <br/>
	Something which sets the black poplars ashake with hysterical
	laughter; <br/>
	While slowly the house of day is closing its eastern shutters.
	</p>
	<p>Further down the valley the clustered tombstones recede,
	<br/>
	Winding about their dimness the mist's grey cerements, after
	<br/>
	The street lamps in the darkness have suddenly started to
	bleed. </p>
	<p>The leaves fly over the window and utter a word as they pass
	<br/>
	To the face that leans from the darkness, intent, with two
	dark-filled eyes<br/>
	That watch for ever earnestly from behind the window glass.
