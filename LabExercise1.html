	<h3>About my planet</h3>
	<p class="first">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. 
	In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.
	The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive
	among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
	The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the
	rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, 
	the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, 
	one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet 
	and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. 
	These may be captured asteroids,similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
	</p>
	<p>
	Mars has been explored by numerous unmanned spacecraft.
	Mariner 4, launched by NASA on November 28, 1964, was the first spacecraft to visit Mars, 
	making its closest approach to the planet on July 15, 1965.
